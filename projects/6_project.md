In July 2025, I took part in Soapbox Science as a speaker. Soapbox Science is novel public outreach platform for promoting women and non-binary scientists and the science they do.

In TÃ¼bingen's town square I stood atop a soapbox and spoke to the public about my work tracking and predicting mental health symptoms, with a specific focus on OCD.
