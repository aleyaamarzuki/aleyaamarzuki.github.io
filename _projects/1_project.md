Mental health symptoms fluctuate substantially over time and can take place along a rapid timescale. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), symptoms are known to fluctuate even within a single day. However, it is unknown what drives these fluctuations. This is a major challenge because knowing when and how symptoms fluctuate would be critical to deliver just-in-time interventions and to prevent acute mental health crises.

Using a naturalistic at-home study where people with OCD reported their symptoms on a mobile phone app and also completed cognitive tests, I found that lowered confidence (metacognition), both in the self- and during a decision-making game, preceded when OCD symptoms would occur within the timescale of just a few hours!

This implies the potential for tracing metacognitive fluctuations, thereby enabling us to deliver interventions to prevent symptoms from worsening when risk is its peak.
