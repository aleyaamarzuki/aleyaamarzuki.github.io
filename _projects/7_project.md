Whilst volunteering with Small Changes, I designed and facilitated seminars coaching refugee school students on topics ranging from cultural integration to internet and financial literacy. 

The aim of this programme was to equip students with the skills necessary to thrive in Malaysian society and ultimately enter the workforce.

In collaboration with Ayesha Marzuki, I ran a fundraiser to aid in purchasing school supplies for <a href="https://www.saveschooledu.org/about/">Save School</a>, a Malaysian-based school dedicated to providing education to refugee youths.
