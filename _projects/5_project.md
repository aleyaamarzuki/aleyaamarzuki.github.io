Scientists4Palestine is an international organisation created by and for scientists to support science in the Occupied Palestinian territories and integrate Palestine into the international scientific community.

I am part of the Webinars comittee: I am aiding in the organisation of the <a href="https://www.scientists4palestine.org/bisan-lecture-series/">Bisan Lecture Series</a>: a series of webinars delivered by experts on diverse topics, ranging from scholasticide (def: the intended mass destruction of education in a specific place, see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/israel-destroying-schools-scholasticide">Gaza</a>) to neural network dynamics to mathematics and AI. 
All webinars are free, open to the public, and include real-time Arabic translations.
