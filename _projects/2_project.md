I co-led the development of AGEWELL, a cohort study wherein 400 Malaysian adults aged 60 years and above underwent extensive cognitive, neuroimaging, and salivary testing. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366364517_AGEWELL_Investigating_the_predictors_of_healthy_neurocognitive_ageing_in_a_socioeconomically_and_ethnically_diverse_Malaysian_cohort?channel=doi&linkId=639d2fc3095a6a7774373d0e&showFulltext=true  

My team and I collected data on-site from community-dwelling senior citizens from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, thereby making this cohort first-of-its-kind in the region.

Our seminal paper characterised cognitive profiles within this unique older population and found that:

<ol>
  <li>Cognitive rigidity was associated with widespread grey matter volume loss in key executive function brain regions.</li>
  <li>Slowness in decision-making was associated with advanced brain ageing (i.e., higher brain age compared to chronological age).</li>
  <li>Above other factors, older people who experienced more socioeconomic disadvantage across their life (i.e., in income, in education, in housing, and in career opportunities) showed worse cognitive abilities in older age.</li>
</ol>

This research serves as a powerful reminder of the hidden ways socioeconomic disparities shape our brain health over a lifetime. Thus, addressing social inequality is not just an economic or moral imperative, it's a crucial public health strategy.
