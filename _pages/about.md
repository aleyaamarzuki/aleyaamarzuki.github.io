Selamat Datang! I am a cognitive scientist from Malaysia with nearly a decade of experience researching mental health conditions. My research aims to address: 

<ol>
  <li>Precisely how structural inequalities contribute to mental health crises</li>
  <li>How best to intervene and support people affected</li>
  <li>How to inform policies for the eradication of poverty through an evidence-based, scientific, and anti-capitalist lens</li>
</ol>

My research skills span ecological momentary testing (mobile sensing), neuroimaging methods (fMRI and EEG), cognitive assessments, computational modelling, and structured interviews.

As an early-career researcher, I am constantly seeking out ways to make meaningful societal contributions through science and to give back to communities who participate in research studies. I am currently looking to collaborate with like-minded groups working in social justice, policy, and charity sectors.

I am a strong advocate for science being open, fair, and decolonial.
