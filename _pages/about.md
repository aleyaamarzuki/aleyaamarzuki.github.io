Selamat Datang! I am a cognitive scientist from Malaysia with 8 years of experience researching mental health. My research aims to understand precisely how structural inequalities contribute to mental health crises, how best to intervene and support people affected, and to inform policies for the eradication of poverty through an evidence-based, anti-capitalist lens.

My research skills span ecological momentary testing (mobile sensing), neuroimaging methods (fMRI and EEG), cognitive assessments, computational modelling, and structured interviews.

As an early-career researcher, I am constantly seeking out ways to make meaningful societal contributions through science and to give back to communities who participate in research studies. I am currently looking to collaborate with like-minded groups working in social justice, policy, and charity sectors across Malaysia and the United Kingdom.

I am a strong advocate for science being open, fair, and decolonial.
